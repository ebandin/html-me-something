<h3> Tales Under Thelogical Consideration</h3>
	<p> 
		A tri-story intended to express the near-death experiences that have led an otherwise pragmatic man to consider the interventions of the divine.

			Not always a man, as a young boy one recreational trip to Hawaii surprised him with a new acquaintance in death. Father and Brother both had set themselves upon climbing a muddy path parellel a waterfall. Shirking Mother's protests, the young boy followed the two older men set upon proving himself an equal in bravery. Atop the waterfall the three found a breathtaking&nbsp;vista. <br/> <br/> 
			
			Perhaps then, it was no more than an Icarus-blind conviction that extended the venture to cross the muddy stones at the mouth of the waterfall and reach the higher vantage at the other end. The elder two found their way without incident, but when our youngest sought to leap the last stone to safety the current surged and pulled him into the riptide. Father and Brother each watched helplessly as he sunk shoulder deep and was precipitously dragged to end of the earth. Reaching helplessly toward them, instead he found a notably unseen sturdy vine clasped in his hand. Contesting forces whiplashed the boy, but it&nbsp;was&nbsp;life&nbsp;that&nbsp;prevailed.

		Recently minted in his manhood, the Man found anger to be a defining characteristic of his forays into independence and the injustices found therein. One such percieved injustice was the weather, and a midnight cross-state trip to heavy metal radio provided a breaking point in this. Fervent gusts of wind seemed intent to drive his aged mobile right into the swampland along the interstate. Ignoring serveral kindred drivers parked in the service lanes with hazards ablaze in warning, the intractable&nbsp;Man charged into the darkening horizon with gritted teeth. <br/> <br/> 
		As conditions worsened so too did his temper, including funnels of rain and a sailor's dictionary of curses respectively. Man and nature each dared the other to back down and neither found themselves heeded. It was in this context that Man decided to call&nbsp;the&nbsp;Manager, directing his spree of spite to whatever entity might hear his derision. Under duress, the accused struck back in kind with a bolt of lightning mere yards from the hood of the car. The singular strike temporarily blinded the man, deemed the radio to silence, and combust a nearby transformer into a firey ball. He sulked out of the storm with all due humility.

		The most recent such glance with death was not the Man's own, but was instead that of his Mother. See, for all her inclinations to nuture others in need she was remiss to find herself with a dire cervical&nbsp;sickness. The Man was beside himself, no longer with anger, but with shock. In a short order of weeks her health slipped and she was <em>languishing</em> in an emergency room. Afraid at his own sheer impotence in the face of illness he first hesitated to visit, yet made his amends and slipped-in the hospital past visiting hours. <br/> <br/>
		As he drew the curtains to her narrow bed, a young girl in the likeness of his kid cousin spirited past him from within. He asked &quot;How is it that Cousin came by so late?&quot; and she replied in a half-sleep that no one till now had visited today. Not one to suffer delusions the Man turned to find that indeed there was no one. As he returned small part of the many favors of comfort she'd provided, he ruminated all the while on the vision's boon. Exiting the scene his footsteps echoed the sensibility of the forgone conlusion of her recovery.
