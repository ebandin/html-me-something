		<h4> Tales Under Theologic Consideration</h4>
	<p> 
		A story intended to express three near-death experiences that have led an otherwise pragmatic man to consider the interventions of the divine.  
	</p>
	<li> <i>Waterfall</i> 
	<ul> 
		<p> 
			Not always a man, as a young boy one recreational trip to Hawaii surprised him with a new acquaintance in death. Father and Brother both had set themselves upon climbing a muddy path parellel a waterfall. Shirking Mother's protests, the young boy followed the two older men set upon proving himself an equal in bravery. Atop the waterfall the three found a breathtaking vista. <br> 
			
			Perhaps then, it was no more than an Icarus-blind conviction that extended the venture to cross the muddy stones at the mouth of the waterfall and reach the higher vantage at the other end. The elder two found their way without incident, but when our youngest sought to leap the last stone to safety the current surged and pulled him into the riptide. Father and Brother each watched helplessly as he sunk shoulder deep and was precipitously dragged to end of the earth. Reaching helplessly toward them, instead he found a notably unseen sturdy vine clasped in his hand. Contesting forces whiplashed the boy, but it was life that prevailed.

	<li> <i>The Storm </i> 
	<ul> 
		<p> 
		Recently minted in his manhood, the Man found anger to be a defining characteristic of his forays into independence and the injustices found therein. One such percieved injustice was the weather, which despite best planning, seemed intent to gust his aged mobile right into the swampland along the interstate.
